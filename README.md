there are 2 input files.

1.  is the main shopify export.
2.  is a single file with urls only. (i think i should change the name of this column reference in the script so that it matches the shopify export)
    or i could make the script reference the first colmn only.

add both of these files to a folder called excel-files on the root of the project. Call each file "products.xlsx" and "urls.xlsx"
